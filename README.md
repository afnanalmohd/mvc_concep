# The Garage QR Reader App

<br>

**QR Reader** was completed by <a href="https://thegarage.sa">TheGarage</a>
mobile application development team. It is built using <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install"> Flutter</a>.
The team used <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/get">Getx</a> framework for state management.
The primary goal of the QR Reader is to scan barcodes and verify event invitations. The QR code will be used to determine the status of the barcode, indicating whether the login was successful or if the event is closed or has ended.
